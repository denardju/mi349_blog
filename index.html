            <h2>Metaverse and Bringing Media to Market</h2>
            <p> The methods used to bring media to market have changed yearly in recent memory. 
                When it comes to what the future holds we have already started to see the resources and strategies that companies plan 
                to use to entice consumers. As people stray further away from the older forms of media (television, radio, etc.) 
                We have begun to see the tip of the iceberg in terms of the new methods corporations are using to bring media to market. 
                The Metaverse has been a hot topic of debate recently but regardless of the public opinion on it, VR is something that advertisers 
                have had their eye on for a long time. I think there is soon going to be a huge breakthrough with advertisements using virtual reality. 
                It is already possible to own VR goods and I think the next step is marketing within these virtual realities. According to Research and Markets, 
                the global AR & VR market will have a total worth of 1.3 trillion dollars by 2030. I think companies will begin to create an immersive experience 
                that they think their target audience will enjoy. This way they can easily convert users' attention to revenue dollars.</p>
