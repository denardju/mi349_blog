    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>HelIo, my name is Justin Denard. I'am a Game and Interactive Media student at Michigan State University. 
        I began my gaming journey after becoming a fan of fighting game mechanics and character design. 
        This led to having an interest in E-sports and many of their gameplay systems. I am interested in positions in Game and 
        Level Design. After I obtain my degree my goal is to create a franchise of games that garners fandom using dynamic character 
        design and unique level creation.
